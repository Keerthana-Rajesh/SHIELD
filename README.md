## 🧠 System Workflow (High Level)

1. User completes one-time signup and configuration  
2. Background AI monitoring service starts automatically  
3. AI or volume-button keyword detects an emergency  
4. Fake call can be used preventively after app login  
5. Severity-based emergency actions are executed  
6. Evidence is securely uploaded and managed in the cloud
